# My Personal portfolio test
In this project, I'm making a simple animated (gamified) version of my portfolio that is quick and easty to use, especially with mobile devices. I also want to try to make the content as dynamic as possible. However, this is a test version made with jQuery and the actual portfolio site will be build with Angular 7 and Typescript

A full but temporary version of my portfolio can be found: www.villepajala.com
