# My Personal portfolio web app
In this project, I'm making a simple animated (gamified) version of my portfolio that is quick and easty to use, especially with mobile devices. I also want to try to make the content as dynamic as possible, so you'll find only one HTML file with just one element. Everything else is written with JavaScript (jQuery) and stylized with CSS.
